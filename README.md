# Learning GIT!


# are these changes not going to be accepted?

## What I've learned
1. git clone (repository address here) - creates a copy of the files in the repository onto your local computer
2. git status - will tell you what changes have been made, and if any files are just untracked.
3. git add - will make your file tracked
    * git add. will include all the files
4. git commit -m - will commit your file, and let the owner of the file know what is being done. 
5. git push - to push a change to the file, you must prove that you own the file using SSH key
